                                Best Actors
                                -----------

    This is a personal project of a web site presenting my top 5 greatest 
    actors. The idea was to familiarize myself with the JS and its library
    jQuery to create dynamic web sites.
    As the moment, I developed only the first page with my top 5 greatest 
    actresses. I will see later if I feel like improving it, with my top 5
    greatest actors for instance.
    
    I choose to share it on GitHub to keep an example for my future projects
    but also for the people starting with JS/jQuery. So do not hesitate to 
    use it as example.

    permit to link the CSS and JS files, respectively "style.css" & "script.js" 
    N.B: Click on this HTML file to launch the website on your web browser.
    
    The file is mainly composed of 2 parts:
        - The head : defines the title and links the CSS & JS/jQuery files.
        - The body : defines the structure of the page.



    2- CSS FILE : style.css

    This file gives the style of the website, otherwise it will be a little
    bit rustic if not sad.
